## Settings

### Block ID Format

You can customize the format of block IDs using MomentJS formatting tokens. Here are some examples:

- `YYYYMMDDHHmmss` ‚Üí 20250308120000 (basic timestamp)
- `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-mm-ss` ‚Üí 2025-03-08T12-00-00 (with date separators)
- `YYMMDD-HHmm` ‚Üí 250308-1200 (shorter format)
- `YYYYMMDDHHmmssSSS` ‚Üí 20250308120000123 (with milliseconds)

### Timestamp Format

When appending timestamps to links, you can customize the format using MomentJS formatting tokens. Here are some examples:

- `[üìù ]YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm` ‚Üí üìù 2025-03-08T08:07 (with emoji)
- `[(]YYYY-MM-DD[)]` ‚Üí (2025-03-08) (with parentheses)
- `[Added: ]HH:mm` ‚Üí Added: 08:07 (with text prefix)
- `[on ]dddd[, ]MMMM Do` ‚Üí on Saturday, March 8th (with day name)

### Open Task Customization

You can append custom text to open tasks (lines starting with "- [ ]") when sending them to Canvas. This is useful for adding tags, metadata, or other information to tasks.

Example:
- Original: `- [ ] Task description`
- Modified: `- [ ] Task description [l:: #Canvas ]`

## Selection Behavior

When no text is selected and the cursor is on a line, the plugin will use the entire line as content to send to Canvas without visually selecting/highlighting the line. This allows you to quickly send content without disrupting your workflow.
